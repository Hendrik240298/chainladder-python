        The ethos governing `chainladder-python` is that it: 
        1. Is an engine for triangle manipulation and reserves setting. It is not a reserving system, but can be a major component in a reserving system. 
        2. Conforms to `pandas` and `sklearn` API in a strict sense. Deviations from these APIs is strongly discouraged.
