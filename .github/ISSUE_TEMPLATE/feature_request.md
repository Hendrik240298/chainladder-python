**Is your feature request at odds with the scope of the package?**

1. Is an engine for triangle manipulation and reserve setting. It is not a reserving system, but can be a major component in a reserving system, such as [FASLR](https://faslr.com/).
2. Conforms to `pandas` and `sklearn` API in a strict sense. Deviations from these APIs is discouraged.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
